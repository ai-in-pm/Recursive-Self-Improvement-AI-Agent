# Gödel Agent Framework for Recursive Self-Improvement

A Python framework implementing self-modifying AI agents based on Gödel's incompleteness theorems. This framework enables agents to analyze and modify their own code during runtime, achieve self-awareness, and recursively optimize their decision-making processes.

## Features

- Dynamic code modification during runtime
- Recursive self-improvement through policy optimization
- Adaptive environment complexity
- Comprehensive logging and state tracking
- Support for multiple agent instances
- Flexible objective functions (environment-based or optimization-based)
- Integration with various AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recursive-self-improvement.git
cd recursive-self-improvement
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Usage

```python
from godel_agent.app import GodelAgentManager, AgentConfig

# Initialize the manager
manager = GodelAgentManager()

# Create an agent for optimization
config = AgentConfig(
    name="optimizer_agent",
    objective_type="optimization"
)
agent_id = manager.create_agent(config)

# Train and evaluate
training_results = manager.train_agent(agent_id)
eval_metrics = manager.evaluate_agent(agent_id)
```
